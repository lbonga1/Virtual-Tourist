# Virtual-Tourist

The Virtual Tourist app allows users to drop a pin on a map, 
  then photos taken in that location are downloaded from Flickr.

By tapping on the dropped pin, the downloaded photos can be viewed in a collection view.
  In this view the user also has the option of downloading a new collection of photos.

If the user taps on a photo, they are shown a confirmation to delete it.
  If the photo is deleted, a new downloaded photo will take its place.
